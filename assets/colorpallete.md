Great image! Based on the "DevHopeful" branding, I can suggest a sleek color scheme that complements the geometric blue design:

## Primary Color Scheme

**Primary Colors:**
- **Deep Navy Blue**: `#0a1628` - The dominant dark background color
- **Bright Cyan/Aqua**: `#00d9ff` - The vibrant accent used in the logo and geometric pattern
- **Medium Blue**: `#1e3a5f` - Mid-tone blue for depth

**Secondary/Accent Colors:**
- **Light Cyan**: `#5ae5ff` - Lighter variant for hover states and highlights
- **Dark Cyan**: `#00a8cc` - Darker variant for borders and contrast
- **Off White**: `#f0f4f8` - For text on dark backgrounds
- **Soft Gray**: `#8b9db5` - For secondary text and subtle elements

## Usage Suggestions

- **Background**: Use the deep navy (`#0a1628`) as your primary background
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: The bright cyan (`#00d9ff`) with hover state using light cyan (`#5ae5ff`)
- **Text**: Off white (`#f0f4f8`) for primary text, soft gray (`#8b9db5`) for secondary
- **Borders/Dividers**: Dark cyan (`#00a8cc`) or medium blue (`#1e3a5f`)
- **Accents**: The geometric triangle pattern suggests you could use gradients between the various blue tones

This scheme maintains the professional, tech-forward aesthetic while providing excellent contrast and readability. The cyan accent color really pops against the dark navy, perfect for a developer-focused brand!
